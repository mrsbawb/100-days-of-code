# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 20, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the Javascript lessons on Colt Steele's "The Web Developer Bootcamp. Covered For Loops and Functions. 

**Thoughts:** I'm re-learning the basics of Javascript for about the third time now. It's definitely making more sense this time around, and I'm beginning to feel less lost.

### Day 4: January 23, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Read a couple of chapters from Eloquent Javascript, and did exercises from chapter 2. Also attempted a few other random exercises not from the book.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm beginning to get a better handle on If/Else statements, and was happy to be able to complete the FizzBuzz exercise without looking at the answer.
